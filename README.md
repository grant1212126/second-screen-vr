# second-screen-vr
A VR application designed to test the implications of introducing second screens to users while watching content in VR.

No videos are included in the repository and need to be important into application.

Scene_02 is included with the repository files with the correct objects instanciated, however the variables in the Experiment Controller object all need to be manually allocated to their corresponding object/ value. For example, each video for the main screen needs to be imported into unity and allocated to each element in the "Video Clips" array.
